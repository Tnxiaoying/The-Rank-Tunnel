# The Rank Tunnel Project

Code and figures for my fourth (and upcoming fifth) paper on thermodynamic
scaling in the "rank tunnel" regime.

- `rank_tunnel_scaling.py` – main scaling experiments for Paper 4.
- `rank_breathing*.py` – breathing / phase-diagram style experiments.
- `phase_diagram*.png`, `论文图片*.png` – figures used in the paper(s).
- `rank_paper.odt`, `对折报告*.odt`, `介绍.odt` – draft manuscripts and reports (Chinese).

Paper 4 and Paper 5 will share this repository; future code for Paper 5 will
be added under a dedicated subfolder.
